1.  - scientific names: character\
    - count of plants in a quadrat: integer\
    - reaction time of birds to disturbances in seconds: numeric\
    - rain on certain days: logical\
2.  - finds the mean mass -> standard deviation of the bird mass -> finds the outliers\
    - the variables mean_mass and sd_mass don't exclude the NA in bird_mass_g\
    - to fix it you have to add na.rm to all of the varaibales that are calculating somethins using the bird_mass_g variable\
    - bird_mass_g is a numeric,is_outlier is a logic, num_outliers is a integer\

3. - you can change the 0L in the quad_counts to 6 so that it the median is 5L after filtering
